# Personalized Jarvis-like Voice Assistant

This project implements a Jarvis-like voice assistant using Python. The assistant is designed to respond to voice commands and perform various tasks. Below, we provide an overview of the features, setup instructions, and usage guide for the voice assistant.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** The assistant can recognize voice commands using speech recognition technology.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** It processes natural language commands to understand user intent and execute corresponding actions.
- **Task Automation:** The assistant can perform various tasks such as sending emails, fetching weather forecasts, playing music, and more.
- **Customization:** Users can customize the assistant's behavior and add new functionalities according to their preferences.

4. **Run the Assistant:**

## Usage

1. **Wake Word Activation:**
Say the wake word (e.g., "Nads") to activate the assistant.

2. **Voice Commands:**
Speak naturally and clearly to issue commands to the assistant. For example:
- "Nads, what's the weather today?"
- "Nads, play my favorite playlist."
- "Nads, send an email to John."
